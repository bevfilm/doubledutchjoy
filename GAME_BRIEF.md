# Double Dutch Joy — Game Brief

## Project Summary

Double Dutch Joy is a joyful 2D arcade game centered on girls playing Double Dutch.

The game is set in 1980s Chicago and draws heavily from Black childhood culture, neighborhood play, music, fashion, food, movement, and the particular pleasure and skill of jumping Double Dutch.

The goal is not to make a large game first.

The immediate goal is to create a small, polished, highly replayable game whose core jumping mechanic feels good.

---

## Core Player Experience

The player should feel:

- Joy
- Rhythm
- Momentum
- Increasing mastery
- Playfulness
- Cultural specificity
- The satisfaction of successfully staying inside the ropes

The player should feel as though they are participating in a lively neighborhood activity rather than playing an abstract platform game.

The game should be easy to understand but increasingly difficult to master.

---

## Core Gameplay Loop

The current core loop is:

1. Enter or remain inside the Double Dutch ropes.
2. Jump and double jump in rhythm.
3. Collect falling or moving "drops."
4. Avoid obstacles.
5. Earn points.
6. Continue as difficulty increases.
7. Miss a jump or otherwise trigger a failure condition.
8. See the final score.
9. Restart and try again.

The current prototype already contains at least some implementation of:

- Jumping
- Double jumping
- Falling collectible items
- Scoring logic
- Rope mechanics
- Failure conditions

The existing GDevelop project should therefore be treated as a working prototype and reference implementation, not discarded automatically.

---

## Collectibles

Current collectible ideas include:

- Lifesaver candies
- Peppermint sticks inside pickles
- Additional culturally appropriate collectibles to be developed later

Collectibles should contribute to the playful, nostalgic personality of the game rather than feeling like generic game tokens.

---

## Obstacles

Current obstacle ideas include:

- Jacks

Additional obstacles may eventually be added, but the MVP does not require a large variety.

---

## MVP

The first MVP should prove that the basic game is fun.

It should contain:

- One playable girl
- One Double Dutch gameplay environment
- Functional rope timing
- Jump
- Double jump
- Collectibles
- At least one obstacle type
- Score tracking
- A clear failure condition
- Game-over state
- Restart
- Basic sound feedback
- Enough visual and audio feedback for jumping and collecting to feel satisfying

The MVP should be playable repeatedly as a short arcade experience.

A player should be able to understand what to do without needing a complicated tutorial.

---

## MVP Success Question

The most important question is:

**Is jumping Double Dutch, collecting items, avoiding obstacles, and chasing a higher score enjoyable enough that the player wants to immediately play another round?**

Until the answer to that question is yes, expansion features should remain secondary.

---

## Visual Direction

The current project is conceived as a 2D game.

The visual identity should draw from:

- 1980s Chicago
- Black girlhood
- Neighborhood street and playground culture
- Period clothing
- Period hairstyles
- Bright, joyful visual energy

The game should feel culturally specific rather than like a generic "retro" game with 1980s decoration applied afterward.

The existing prototype assets should be reviewed before creating replacement art.

---

## Audio Direction

Sound is important to the experience.

Possible elements include:

- Rope sounds
- Footfalls
- Successful jump feedback
- Collectible sounds
- Crowd or neighborhood reactions
- Encouragement from people watching
- Music influenced by the sound of the 1980s

An earlier concept was inspired by Frankie Smith's "Double Dutch Bus," potentially including the song if licensing were ever possible.

Do not use copyrighted commercial music in the MVP unless appropriate rights have been secured.

Original, licensed, commissioned, or otherwise legally usable music can be explored later.

---

## Cultural Tone

This game is primarily about joy.

Black girls should be allowed to exist inside the game as children playing, competing, laughing, developing skill, expressing themselves, and enjoying their neighborhood and one another.

The game does not need trauma or hardship to justify its cultural setting.

Cultural details should emerge through the environment, characters, food, music, clothing, movement, language, and play itself.

---

## Existing Prototype

A playable prototype was created in GDevelop.

Before making major changes:

1. Inspect the complete GDevelop project.
2. Document what currently works.
3. Identify reusable assets.
4. Identify broken, unfinished, or unused systems.
5. Determine whether extending the existing GDevelop version or rebuilding the MVP in another web-compatible framework is the more practical approach.
6. Do not overwrite or destroy the original GDevelop project.

The original prototype should remain available as a reference even if development later moves to another technology.

---

## Development Philosophy

Prioritize:

1. Playability
2. Feel
3. Clarity
4. Cultural personality
5. Replayability

before:

- Large amounts of content
- Complex progression
- Multiple locations
- Extensive customization
- Narrative expansion
- Online systems
- Monetization systems

Every proposed feature should answer:

**Does this make the core Double Dutch experience more fun?**

If not, it can wait.

---

## Future Possibilities — Not MVP Requirements

Earlier versions of the concept included a much larger game built around Double Dutch competition.

Ideas worth preserving for possible later development include:

- Tricks
- Rhythm-based input sequences
- Double Dutch teams
- Multiple playable girls
- Individual personalities
- Hairstyles
- Clothing and outfits
- Hair accessories
- Winning poses
- Victory marches
- Tournament competition
- National travel
- International travel
- New locations
- Story progression
- Increasingly difficult competitors
- Score multipliers
- Combo systems
- Crowd reactions
- Changing environments or time of day

These are ideas for future evaluation.

They should NOT be interpreted as requirements for the first MVP.

---

## Narrative Possibilities

An earlier concept gave the girls a larger family story and placed them with a grandmother who worked to support them and travel to their competitions.

Story should not be developed deeply until the arcade gameplay works.

There is also a location inconsistency in the early notes that needs to be resolved before narrative development:

- Current Double Dutch Joy notes describe the setting as the South Side of Chicago.
- Earlier Double Dutch Bus notes describe the girls as living in Cabrini-Green.

Do not silently resolve this discrepancy.

Treat the exact Chicago neighborhood as an open creative decision.

---

## Current Development Goal

The immediate goal is:

**Turn the existing prototype into one polished, replayable Double Dutch arcade experience.**

Do not attempt to build the entire larger Double Dutch universe yet.

First make jumping rope fun.
